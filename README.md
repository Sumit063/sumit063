# 👋 Hi, I’m Sumit Pandey

Backend & systems-oriented - full-stack software engineer with a strong foundation in **distributed systems, networking, operating systems, and AI-powered tooling**.  
I enjoy building practical tools and platforms that are **observable, debuggable, and production-minded**.

**Open to remote backend / systems / AI engineering roles.**

## 🧠 Core Skill Set

**Backend & Systems**
- Backend services and APIs (Python, Go, Java, Node.js)
- Async processing, background workers, job queues
- PostgreSQL, Redis, object storage
- Docker, systemd, Linux server environments

**Operating Systems & Linux**
- Linux internals (processes, memory, file systems, signals)
- SSH-based access models, **Teleport**, secure remote access
- Debugging system behavior via logs, metrics, and runtime signals

**Networking (System Thinking + Hands-on)**
- Solid understanding of core protocols: **TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP(S), TLS**
- How applications behave across networks, proxies, and tunnels
- Hands-on debugging of connectivity, latency, and protocol issues
- Experience reasoning about networked systems end-to-end, not just packets

**AI Engineering**
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Gemini, Hugging Face)
- Prompt design, structured output enforcement
- Embeddings, semantic search, mini-RAG pipelines
- Cost-aware, API-first, production-style AI usage
